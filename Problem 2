Here's how you can approach **Problem Statement 2: Kubernetes Security Scan** step by step and generate the required deliverable.

---

## **Step-by-Step Process**

### **1. Set Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster**
You can use any of the following options:

- **Minikube**  
  ```bash
  minikube start
  ```

- **Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)**  
  ```bash
  kind create cluster
  ```

- **K3s** (lightweight Kubernetes)  
  ```bash
  curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
  ```

Choose the one that best suits your system. **Minikube** is a common choice for quick local development.

---

### **2. Install a Kubernetes Security Tool**

#### Example: **Kubescape**
Kubescape is a widely-used open-source Kubernetes security scanner.

**Install Kubescape CLI**  
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

---

### **3. Run a Kubernetes Security Scan**
Once installed and your local cluster is running, scan it:

```bash
kubescape scan --format json --output k8s-findings.json
```

This command will generate a file named `k8s-findings.json` containing all the findings in JSON format.

---

### **4. Submit Deliverable**
You can now submit the `k8s-findings.json` file as your deliverable.

If youâ€™d like, you can upload the file here and I can help interpret or format it if needed.

Would you like help installing the tools or running the commands on your machine?
