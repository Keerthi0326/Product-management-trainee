Here’s a complete solution tailored to your **Product Requirement and Low-Fidelity Wireframes** problem statement, covering everything from understanding the user need to final deliverables.

---

## **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### **1. Title**
**Container Image Vulnerability Scanner**

---

### **2. Background / Task**
In a containerized environment, security risks often stem from vulnerabilities in dependencies packaged within container images. With thousands of images stored in repositories, users need a streamlined way to:
- Identify images with vulnerabilities.
- Assess the severity of those vulnerabilities.
- Take action quickly and efficiently, especially for critical/high severity issues.

---

### **3. User Problem**
**As a user**, I need to:
- Know **which container images are vulnerable**.
- Understand **how severe the vulnerabilities are**.
- **Prioritize and fix** images with **critical or high vulnerabilities**.
- Do this across **thousands of images** efficiently.

---

### **4. Goals**
- Scan and present vulnerabilities per image.
- Support filtering/sorting by severity.
- Provide detailed vulnerability information (CVE ID, fix availability, package affected).
- Help users take action (fix, export, rescan, tag).

---

### **5. User Personas**
| Persona | Goal |
|--------|------|
| DevOps Engineer | Quickly identify and patch vulnerable images. |
| Security Analyst | Audit and analyze vulnerabilities in detail. |
| Engineering Manager | View high-level risk metrics and trends. |

---

### **6. Key Features**

#### A. **Dashboard Overview**
- Total number of container images scanned.
- Total number of images with critical/high vulnerabilities.
- Pie/bar chart of vulnerability severity distribution.
- Recent scans and timestamps.

#### B. **Image Vulnerability Table**
- Columns:
  - Image Name
  - Tag
  - Last Scanned
  - #Critical, #High, #Medium, #Low
  - Fix Available (Yes/No)
- Actions:
  - Filter by severity, fix availability.
  - Search by image name.
  - Sortable columns.

#### C. **Image Details Page**
- CVE ID
- Severity
- Description
- Affected Package
- Fix Version
- Link to CVE advisory
- Action button: “View Fix” or “Mark as Resolved”

#### D. **Bulk Actions Modal**
- Export vulnerabilities (CSV/PDF)
- Rescan selected images
- Tag images for priority or follow-up

---

### **7. Non-functional Requirements**
- Secure user authentication (role-based access)
- Scalable backend to handle thousands of images
- Responsive web UI for different screen sizes
- High-performance search and filtering

---

### **8. Success Metrics**
- Average time to detect and resolve critical vulnerabilities
- % of critical/high issues fixed within defined SLAs
- Adoption rate of remediation actions (export, fix, rescan)

---

## **Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Screens)**

You now have the first wireframe already created (dashboard view). Remaining screen descriptions:

---

### **1. Dashboard View**
Already delivered – includes:
- Summary metrics
- Vulnerability pie chart
- Search/filter controls
- Image table preview

---

### **2. Image Table View (Expanded)**
- Same layout as dashboard table section but full page
- Add pagination
- Export/Tag/Rescan bulk action buttons at top right

---

### **3. Image Details View**
- Header: Image name + tag
- Vulnerability list with detailed table:
  - CVE ID | Severity | Package | Fix Version | Action
- “Remediation Steps” panel

---

### **4. Modal – Export/Rescan/Tag**
- Modal triggered by selecting multiple images
- Buttons: “Export CSV”, “Rescan”, “Apply Tag”
- Drop-down to select tags (e.g., “To Fix”, “Deprioritized”)

---

## **Bonus: Development Action Items**

### **Frontend**
- Build responsive dashboard and table components
- Implement modal and filter controls
- Create image detail page with expandable vulnerability rows

### **Backend**
- API to fetch scanned image data, vulnerabilities, metadata
- CVE integration (e.g., NVD API)
- Fix suggestion service
- Tagging and export functionality

### **Infrastructure**
- Scheduled container scans (integrate tools like Trivy or Clair)
- Store scan results in a scalable DB
- User roles & permissions system

---

Would you like me to now generate wireframes for the **Image Details View**, **Table View (Full)**, and **Modal** as well?
